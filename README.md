<h2>Description</h2>
The "IoT-Based Smart Gardening System" project is designed to facilitate automated garden maintenance. It incorporates sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and detect fire or smoke. The system uses an Arduino UNO, NodeMCU microcontroller, and a range of sensors. A water pump and fertilizer dispenser are controlled automatically or manually through a smartphone app connected via Wi-Fi and Firebase. An AI model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is included for plant disease detection, classifying images as "Healthy," "Rust," or "Powdery." This project aims to enhance convenience, sustainability, and efficient garden care.
